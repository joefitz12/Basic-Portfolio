    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I attended Purdue University where I studied Economics and Creative Writing. After graduation, I moved to Indianapolis where I spent 3 years working for Angie's List in many different capacities including customer support, fulfillment, and operations, finally landing as a Program Manager for the Fulfillment Lab. After Angie's List, I worked for another Indianapolis based company-Lessonly-in Sales Development. Lessonly is a high-growth SaaS company in the learning space. It was at Lessonly, and because of the amazing experience I had there, where I decided to pursue coding as a career!</p>
        <br />
        <p>In addition to both of those careers, I've been performing comedy for the past 5 years. What started as an interest in performing at standup open mics has become a second life, and pushed me to move to Chicago to study at the theaters here. You can see some of my work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/familyfriends" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
